# BIRD Lab website

The public website for the **Bio-Informed Research & Design (BIRD) Lab** at UC
Davis — built as a static [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) site, hosted free on
**GitHub Pages**, and designed so that non-technical lab members can keep it
current by editing plain text files.

## Quick start (run it on your computer)

You only need this to preview changes locally. Editing through GitHub's website
(see [CONTENT-GUIDE.md](CONTENT-GUIDE.md)) needs no setup at all.

**Easiest (recommended):** install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/), then:
```bash
./serve.sh        # builds in a container, serves http://localhost:4000
```
This avoids compiling Ruby gems on your Mac.

**Native Ruby** (if you prefer): `bundle install`, then `bundle exec jekyll serve`.
On recent macOS this can fail on the `eventmachine` gem — see the fix in
[DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md#troubleshooting-native-bundle-install-on-macos).

## What's where

```
.
├── _config.yml          ← site-wide settings (title, URLs, member-portal link)
├── index.html           ← Home page
├── research.html        people.html  publications.html  facilities.html
├── news.html  join.md  contact.md  portal.md  404.html
├── lab-guide/index.html ← Lab Guide hub
├── _guide/*.md          ← Lab Guide wiki pages (one file per page)
├── _data/               ← THE CONTENT YOU'LL EDIT MOST
│   ├── people.yml          team members, grouped by role
│   ├── publications.yml    journal articles (auto-updated)
│   ├── publications_manual.yml  conference papers, posters, talks, blogs
│   ├── pub_links.yml        data/code/figure per paper, matched by DOI
│   ├── research.yml        research themes + active projects
│   ├── updates.yml         news/milestones timeline
│   ├── press.yml           "In the news" external coverage
│   ├── recognition.yml     home-page honors + "featured in" media
│   ├── funders.yml         home-page "supported by" logos
│   ├── partners.yml        partners / affiliates strip
│   ├── gallery.yml         "scenes from the lab" photos
│   ├── facilities.yml      facility descriptions
│   └── navigation.yml      top menu
├── _layouts/  _includes/ ← page templates (rarely touched)
├── assets/              ← CSS, JS, logo, images
├── scripts/             ← publications sync + image-optimization scripts
├── CONTRIBUTING.md      ← how lab members submit updates + delegation
└── .github/             ← workflows (deploy · publications · checks) + issue forms
```

**Rule of thumb:** content lives in `_data/*.yml` and the `_guide/*.md` /
`*.md` pages. Design lives in `assets/` and `_layouts/`. You can do almost all
day-to-day updates without touching the design.

## The four planning questions, answered

### 1 · Content inventory
The current site/lab-guide content was catalogued and mapped to its new home.
Full table in [ARCHITECTURE.md → Content inventory](ARCHITECTURE.md#1-content-inventory).
In short: public "who we are / what we do / get involved" pages became the main
nav; the how-to lab-guide pages became a searchable **wiki**; explicitly internal
pages were **excluded** and point to the private Notion portal.

### 2 · Sitemap
Home · Research · People · Publications · Facilities · Lab Guide (wiki) · News ·
Join · Contact · Member Portal. Diagram in
[ARCHITECTURE.md → Sitemap](ARCHITECTURE.md#2-sitemap).

### 3 · Architecture
Static **Jekyll** site on **GitHub Pages**, content in Markdown + YAML, zero
runtime services, three GitHub Actions + Dependabot. Rationale and trade-offs in
[ARCHITECTURE.md → Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md#3-architecture-decision).

### 4 · Publication workflow
Journal articles sync automatically from **OpenAlex** (by the PI's **ORCID**) via
a monthly GitHub Action that opens a **pull request** for human review. The
committed file is always the source of truth, so the site never breaks if the API
is down. Conference work is curated by hand, and per-paper data/code/figures live
in `_data/pub_links.yml`. Full details in
[MAINTENANCE.md → Publications](MAINTENANCE.md#publications-how-the-automation-works).

## Priorities this build optimizes for

In the project's stated order: **maintainability → accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA) →
scientific communication → automation → design quality → visual effects.** Where
these traded off, the higher priority won — e.g. plain editable data files over
a fancier headless CMS, and semantic HTML that works without JavaScript.
